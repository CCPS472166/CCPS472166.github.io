  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> 1. What am I working toward in my personal and professional life and what experiences led me here? 
    As someone with many interests and passions, I have come across many careers and hobbies, but you can only do so much! 
    I have prioritized my health, happiness and mindset for my future. 
    When I was younger I struggled with chronic Lyme's disease and although a lot of my childhood was taken away, I still had sports! 
    I love moving my body and hope to pursue a side hustle in holistic health.
    I have a certificate in Traditional Chinese Medicine and understand many tricks and tips to a healthier life. 
    Another big passion I have is construction and design, a major part of my life is structure and balance,
    being able to do that physically and professionally is great but being able to keep everyone around me structured is even better!</p>
   <p> 2. How am I working toward these goals?
    I spend lots of time working out, learning about the newest research, doing my research and getting a certificate in Chinese Medicine to better understand the body. 
    These have all helped me reach certain goals to brighten my future and expand my mind. Career wise, I plan to intern with local companies and learn all the insights
    to hopefully become a project manager on construction sights. My goals are to minor in architecture and interior design in college to be able to have my own company 
    that does it all!</p>
    <p> 3. What values do I consider most necessary for my success?
    The values I consider most necessary for my success would be determination, mentors, and reliability. 
    These three things are very important to me because I am determined to be the best version of myself for me and those around me. 
    I'm determined to know and do as much as I can in my hobbies and professional career. I appreciate mentors for various reasons, but overall, mentors are truly 
    the stepping stone to your knowledge and help in so many ways. Reliability is not just a valuable goal for my success,
    it is a word that defines me and the people I want to be around. In any aspect of life, reliability will never fail, therefore I will not fail myself, others, or my career.</p>  
    <p> 4. What short-term goals do I hope to accomplish in the near future?
    A few short-term goals I have for myself are getting into either of my dream colleges, University of Miami and Pepperdine, 
    getting another certificate in either herbology, microbiomes, or Chinese Medicine 2, and completing an internship with a construction company.</p>
    <p> 5. What are the character traits and achievements I most want to be known for?
    The character traits and achievements I want to be most known for is my reliability and ability to help others.</p>
